## Overview
We build robust and interpretable ML models to accelerate scientific discovery across domains, with emphasis on generalization, uncertainty, and physical constraints.

## Focus Areas
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
- Graph neural networks for structured scientific data
- Interpretable models and reliability assessment

## Selected Publications
- See our recent work in Nature Machine Intelligence and NeurIPS.
