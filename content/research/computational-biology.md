## Overview
We develop algorithms and tools to analyze complex biological data at scale, from genomes to proteomes, integrating multi-omics data for systems-level understanding.

## Current Projects
- DeepFold: AI-powered protein structure prediction
- Multi-omics integration for disease subtyping
- Single-cell analysis pipelines

## Resources
- Datasets: Public genomics repositories and lab-curated datasets
- Tools: Custom pipelines built on Python, Nextflow, and cloud computing
