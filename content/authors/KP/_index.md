Kristie joined the Coughlin lab before there was a lab.  She started our zebrafish work and quickly became involved in every project. She led our recent [NBS-related work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729892/), and leads all of our patient engagement activities. 

There is a persistent rumor that she joined our lab simply due to her love of Jurasic Park, which might explain the ever growing number of dinasours in the lab.
