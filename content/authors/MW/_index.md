Dr. Woontner had a distinguished career as a biochemical geneticist in the Goodman Labortoray at the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado. After his retirement, he kindly volunteered in the Coughlin Laboratory and serves as a mentor to all of the scientists and students. 

He often joins lab meeting full of ideas, pastries, and a comic strip or two. He can be found in the lab trouble shooting failed experiments, working on cloning experiments, and settling bets.
