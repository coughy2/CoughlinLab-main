Dr. Michael Chen joined our lab in 2022 after completing his PhD at UC San Diego. His research focuses on applying deep learning techniques to predict protein structures and identify potential drug targets.

## Current Projects

- **DeepFold**: Developing next-generation protein structure prediction models
- **DrugAI**: Machine learning pipeline for virtual drug screening
- **ProteinGPT**: Large language models for protein sequence analysis
