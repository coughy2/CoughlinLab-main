## About the Lab

Dr. Curtis Coughlin leads the research laboratory at the University of Colorado Anschutz. He completed his doctoral training with [Dr. Stephen Goodman's](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jimd.12330), whose reserach lab focused on glutraic aciduria type 1 for 45 years. The Coughlin laboratory primary focus is lysine metabolism, which led to the identification of a novel metabolite within the degradation of lysine. This metabolites was later applied to newborn screening for PDE-ALDH7A1. Dr. Coughlin also prioritizes collabortive research approaches. Along with [Dr. Clara van Karnebeek](https://pure.amsterdamumc.nl/en/persons/clara-van-karnebeek/) and members of the [International PDE Consortium](http://wwws.pdeonline.org/), he helped establish the use of lysine reduction therapies for the treatment of PDE-ALDH7A1.

## Research Vision

Our lab focuses on developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to solve complex biological problems. We work at the intersection of computer science, biology, and medicine to:

- **Predict protein structures and functions** using deep learning models
- **Discover new drug targets** through computational screening
- **Analyze genomic data** to understand disease mechanisms
- **Develop open-source tools** for the scientific community

## Leadership & Mentorship

Dr. Coughlin has mentored several learners including indivduials in master degree and PhD progams, medical students and residents, and junior faculty members. He has completed several formal mentoring programs and is committed to fostering an inclusive and collaborative research environment where all team members can thrive.
