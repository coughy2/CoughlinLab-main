abstract: Segmental duplications (SDs) are a class of long, repetitive DNA elements
  whose paralogs share a high level of sequence similarity with each other. SDs mediate
  chromosomal rearrangements that lead to structural variation in the general population
  as well as genomic disorders associated with multiple congenital anomalies, including
  the 7q11.23 (Williams-Beuren Syndrome, WBS), 15q13.3, and 16p12.2 microdeletion
  syndromes. Population-level characterization of SDs has generally been lacking because
  most techniques used for analyzing these complex regions are both labor and cost
  intensive. In this study, we have used a high-throughput technique to genotype complex
  structural variation with a single molecule, long-range optical mapping approach.
  We characterized SDs and identified novel structural variants (SVs) at 7q11.23,
  15q13.3, and 16p12.2 using optical mapping data from 154 phenotypically normal individuals
  from 26 populations comprising five super-populations. We detected several novel
  SVs for each locus, some of which had significantly different prevalence between
  populations. Additionally, we localized the microdeletion breakpoints to specific
  paralogous duplicons located within complex SDs in two patients with WBS, one patient
  with 15q13.3, and one patient with 16p12.2 microdeletion syndromes. The population-level
  data presented here highlights the extreme diversity of large and complex SVs within
  SD-containing regions. The approach we outline will greatly facilitate the investigation
  of the role of inter-SD structural variation as a driver of chromosomal rearrangements
  and genomic disorders.
