abstract: "PURPOSE: Informed consent for genetic testing has historically been acquired
  during pretest genetic counseling, without specific guidance defining which core
  concepts are required. METHODS: The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Consent and
  Disclosure Recommendations Workgroup (CADRe) used an expert consensus process to
  identify the core concepts essential to consent for clinical genetic testing. A
  literature review identified 77 concepts that are included in informed consent for
  genetic tests. Twenty-five experts (9 medical geneticists, 8 genetic counselors,
  and 9 bioethicists) completed two rounds of surveys ranking concepts' importance
  to informed consent. RESULTS: The most highly ranked concepts included: (1) genetic
  testing is voluntary; (2) why is the test recommended and what does it test for?;
  (3) what results will be returned and to whom?; (4) are there other types of potential
  results, and what choices exist?; (5) how will the prognosis and management be impacted
  by results?; (6) what is the potential family impact?; (7) what are the test limitations
  and next steps?; and (8) potential risk of genetic discrimination and legal protections.
  CONCLUSION: Defining the core concepts necessary for informed consent for genetic
  testing provides a foundation for quality patient care across a variety of healthcare
  providers and clinical indications."
