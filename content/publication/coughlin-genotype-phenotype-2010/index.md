abstract: Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD)
  is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation. The phenotype of VLCADD
  is heterogeneous, and patients are typically classified into three categories based
  upon onset of symptoms and clinical findings. As a result of early diagnosis and
  treatment, many patients with VLCADD have remained asymptomatic. A general genotype-phenotype
  correlation has been elicited. A genotype that is associated with residual enzyme
  activity is more likely to present with an attenuated phenotype. One prevailing
  mutation, the c.848TtextgreaterC (p.V283A), has been associated with residual enzyme
  activity and has been identified in many asymptomatic individuals diagnosed through
  either newborn or family screening. We present a patient who died as a result of
  fatal hypoglycemia at 38 h of life before diagnosis of VLCADD could be established
  by newborn screening. Despite the early onset of the disease, the patient was found
  to have a missense mutation within the ACADVL gene with a c.848TtextgreaterC, c.342+1GtextgreaterC
  genotype. Genotype alone remains limited in its predictive ability to determine
  which affected individuals are at risk for fatal complications.
