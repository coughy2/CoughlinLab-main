abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1) is a developmental
  epileptic encephalopathy historically characterized by seizures that are resistant
  to antiseizure medications. Treatment with pyridoxine and lysine reduction therapies
  are associated with seizure control and improved developmental outcomes. In rare
  circumstances, patients have died prior to diagnosis and treatment with pyridoxine,
  and many patients are diagnosed after six months of age when lysine reduction therapies
  have limited efficacy. Recently two new metabolites were identified (2S,6S-/2S,6R-oxopropylpiperidine-2-carboxylic
  acid, 2-OPP and 6-oxo-pipecolate, 6-oxo-pip), and we evaluated these metabolites
  as potential newborn screening biomarkers. METHODS: We recruited participants with
  a confirmed diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1 and retrieved their residual dried blood spots
  from state-sponsored newborn screening programs. We evaluated the dried blood spots
  for 2-OPP using commercially available newborn screening kits and equipment, and
  developed a second-tier test for 6-oxo-pip using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: We received
  eight residual dried blood spots collected before the onset of seizures and the
  diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1. In our newborn screening experiments, 2-OPP was elevated
  in 7 of 8 samples from affected participants with a mean of 3.08 μmol/L (95 % CI
  2.17-3.99) compared to a mean of 0.09 μmol/L (95 % CI 0.09-0.10) in controls (p textless 0.001).
  Second tier testing demonstrated elevated 6-oxo-pip in all samples from affected
  participants with a mean of 5.66 μmol/L (95 % CI 1.51-9.81) and was undetectable
  in controls (p textless 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with PDE-ALDH7A1 can be identified
  using neonatal dried blood spots prior to the onset of symptoms. The use of commercially
  available newborn screening approaches demonstrates the feasibility of newborn screening
  for this treatable condition.'
