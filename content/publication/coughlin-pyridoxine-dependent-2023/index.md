abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) was historically defined by a dramatic
  clinical response to a trial of pyridoxine and the re-emergence of seizures after
  withdrawal of pyridoxine. Research conducted over the last seven decades has revealed
  that the phenotype of PDE results from multiple genetic disorders, and the most
  common disorder, PDE-ALDH7A1, is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme involved in
  lysine metabolism. PDE-ALDH7A1 is characterized by more than epilepsy, as many patients
  have abnormalities of brain development, and most patients have intellectual and
  developmental disability. Treatment aimed at the underlying metabolic defect, in
  addition to pyridoxine supplementation, has improved clinical outcomes. Recently
  discovered biomarkers and genetic testing allow for the diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1
  without the need of a pyridoxine trial and hold the promise for newborn screening.
  Despite these many advances, PDE-ALDH7A1 remains a clinical and biochemical conundrum.
  The increasing use of model systems and an international collaboration of clinician-scientists
  are among the reasons to be optimistic that these questions will be answered in
  the near future and that the clinical outcomes and quality of life will continue
  to improve for patients with PDE-ALDH7A1.
