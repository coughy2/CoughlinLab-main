abstract: We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to determine the genetic etiology of
  a patient with a multi-system disorder characterized by a seizure phenotype. WES
  identified a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in the GABRA1 gene (c.875CtextgreaterT).
  GABRA1 encodes the alpha subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABAAR).
  The GABAAR is a ligand gated ion channel that mediates the fast inhibitory signals
  of the nervous system, and mutations in the subunits that compose the GABAAR have
  been previously associated with human disease. To understand the mechanisms by which
  GABRA1 regulates brain development, we developed a zebrafish model of gabra1 deficiency.
  gabra1 expression is restricted to the nervous system and behavioral analysis of
  morpholino injected larvae suggests that the knockdown of gabra1 results in hypoactivity
  and defects in the expression of other subunits of the GABAAR. Expression of the
  human GABRA1 protein in morphants partially restored the hypomotility phenotype.
  In contrast, the expression of the c.875CtextgreaterT variant did not restore these
  behavioral deficits. Collectively, these results represent a functional approach
  to understand the mechanisms by which loss-of-function alleles cause disease.
