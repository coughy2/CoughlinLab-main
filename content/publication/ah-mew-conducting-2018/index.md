abstract: Organic acidemias and urea cycle disorders are ultra-rare inborn errors
  of metabolism characterized by episodic acute decompensation, often associated with
  hyperammonemia, resulting in brain edema and encephalopathy. Retrospective reports
  and translational studies suggest that N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) may be effective
  in reducing ammonia levels during acute decompensation in two organic acidemias,
  propionic and methylmalonic acidemia (PA and MMA), and in two urea cycle disorders,
  carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (CPSD and
  OTCD). We established the 9-site N-carbamylglutamate Consortium (NCGC) in order
  to conduct two randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of NCG in acute
  hyperammonemia of PA, MMA, CPSD and OTCD. Conducting clinical trials is challenging
  in any disease, but poses unique barriers and risks in the ultra-rare disorders.
  As the number of clinical trials in orphan diseases increases, evaluating the successes
  and opportunities for improvement in such trials is essential. We summarize herein
  the design, methods, experiences, challenges and lessons from the NCGC-conducted
  trials.
