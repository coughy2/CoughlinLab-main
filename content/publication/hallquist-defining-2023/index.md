abstract: The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Consent and Disclosure Recommendation
  (CADRe) framework proposes that key components of informed consent for genetic testing
  can be covered with a targeted discussion for many conditions rather than a time-intensive
  traditional genetic counseling approach. We surveyed US genetics professionals (medical
  geneticists and genetic counselors) on their response to scenarios that proposed
  core informed consent concepts for clinical genetic testing developed in a prior
  expert consensus process. The anonymous online survey included responses to 3 (of
  6 possible) different clinical scenarios that summarized the application of the
  core concepts. There was a binary (yes/no) question asking respondents whether they
  agreed the scenarios included the minimum necessary and critical educational concepts
  to allow an informed decision. Respondents then provided open-ended feedback on
  what concepts were missing or could be removed. At least one scenario was completed
  by 238 respondents. For all but one scenario, over 65% of respondents agreed that
  the identified concepts portrayed were sufficient for an informed decision; the
  exome scenario had the lowest agreement (58%). Qualitative analysis of the open-ended
  comments showed no consistently mentioned concepts to add or remove. The level of
  agreement with the example scenarios suggests that the minimum critical educational
  components for pre-test informed consent proposed in our prior work is a reasonable
  starting place for targeted pre-test discussions. This may be helpful in providing
  consistency to the clinical practice of both genetics and non-genetics providers,
  meeting patients' informational needs, tailoring consent for psychosocial support,
  and in future guideline development.
