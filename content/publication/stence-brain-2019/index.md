abstract: Patients with severe nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) have absent psychomotor
  development and intractable epilepsy, whereas attenuated patients have variable
  psychomotor development and absent or treatable epilepsy; differences in brain magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) between phenotypes have not been reported. In a retrospective
  cross-sectional study, we reviewed 38 MRI studies from 24 molecularly proven NKH
  patients, and 2 transient NKH patients. Quantitative analyses included corpus callosum
  size, apparent diffusion coefficient, automated brain volumetric analysis, and glycine/creatine
  ratio by spectroscopy. All patients age textless3 months had restricted diffusion
  in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, anterior brainstem, posterior tegmental
  tracts, and cerebellum, not present in transient NKH. In older infants, the pattern
  evolved and included generalized diffusion restriction in the supratentorial white
  matter, which quantitatively peaked between 3 and 12 months. No patient had absent
  corpus callosum or gyral malformation. The corpus callosum was relatively short
  in severe compared to attenuated phenotypes, and thin in severe cases only. The
  corpus callosum growth rate differed by severity; age-matched Z-scores of thickness
  worsened in severe cases only. Cerebral volume was decreased in the hippocampus,
  globus pallidus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. Severe patients had
  greatest glycine/creatine ratios. In this study, no brain malformations were identified.
  The growth failure of the corpus callosum is worse in severe NKH, whereas the diffusion
  restriction pattern, reflecting microspongiosis, does not discriminate by phenotypic
  severity. NKH is therefore a disorder of brain growth best recognized in the corpus
  callosum, whereas spongiosis is not prognostic.
