abstract: Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) can be detected
  through newborn screening with tandem mass spectrometry. We report a patient who
  died as a result of severe brain injury due to hypoglycemia. Newborn screening was
  normal. Postmortem enzyme analysis and molecular testing confirmed the diagnosis
  of VLCADD.
