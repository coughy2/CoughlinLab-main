abstract: Muscle, heart and liver were analyzed in a male subject who succumbed to
  HSD10 disease. Respiratory chain enzyme analysis and BN-PAGE showed reduced activities
  and assembly of complexes I, III, IV, and V. The mRNAs of all RNase P subunits were
  preserved in heart and overexpressed in muscle, but MRPP2 protein was severely decreased.
  RNase P upregulation correlated with increased expression of mitochondrial biogenesis
  factors and preserved mitochondrial enzymes in muscle, but not in heart where this
  compensatory mechanism was incomplete. We demonstrate elevated amounts of unprocessed
  pre-tRNAs and mRNA transcripts encoding mitochondrial subunits indicating deficient
  RNase P activity. This study provides evidence of abnormal mitochondrial RNA processing
  causing mitochondrial energy failure in HSD10 disease.
