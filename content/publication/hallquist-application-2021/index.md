abstract: "BACKGROUND: Genetic information is increasingly relevant across healthcare.
  Traditional genetic counseling (GC) may limit access to genetic information and
  may be more information and support than some individuals need. We report on the
  application and clinical implications of a framework to consistently integrate genetics
  expertise where it is most useful to patients. METHODS: The Clinical Genome Resource's
  (ClinGen) Consent and Disclosure Recommendations (CADRe) workgroup designed rubrics
  to guide pre- and post-genetic test communication. Using a standard set of testing
  indications, pre- and post-test rubrics were applied to 40 genetic conditions or
  testing modalities with diverse features, including variability in levels of penetrance,
  clinical actionability, and evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship. Final
  communication recommendations were reached by group consensus. RESULTS: Communication
  recommendations were determined for 478 unique condition-indication or testing-indication
  pairs. For half of the conditions and indications (238/478), targeted discussions
  (moderate communication depth) were the recommended starting communication level
  for pre- and post-test conversations. Traditional GC was recommended pre-test for
  adult-onset neurodegenerative conditions for individuals with no personal history
  and post-test for most conditions when genetic testing revealed a molecular diagnosis
  as these situations are likely higher in complexity and uncertainty. A brief communication
  approach was recommended for more straightforward conditions and indications (e.g.,
  familial hypercholesterolemia; familial variant testing). CONCLUSIONS: The CADRe
  recommendations provide guidance for clinicians in determining the depth of pre-
  and post-test communication, strategically aligning the anticipated needs of patients
  with the starting communication approach. Shorter targeted discussions or brief
  communications are suggested for many tests and indications. Longer traditional
  GC consultations would be reserved for patients with more complex and uncertain
  situations where detailed information, education, and psychological support can
  be most beneficial. Future studies of the CADRe communication framework will be
  essential for determining if CADRe-informed care supports quality patient experience
  while improving access to genetic information across healthcare."
