abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is often characterized as an early onset
  epileptic encephalopathy with dramatic clinical improvement following pyridoxine
  supplementation. Unfortunately, not all patients present with classic neonatal seizures
  or respond to an initial pyridoxine trial, which can result in the under diagnosis
  of this treatable disorder. Restriction of lysine intake and transport is associated
  with improved neurologic outcomes, although treatment should be started in the first
  year of life to be effective. Because of the documented diagnostic delay and benefit
  of early treatment, we aimed to develop a newborn screening method for PDE. Previous
  studies have demonstrated the accumulation of Δ1 -piperideine-6-carboxylate and
  α-aminoadipic semialdehyde in individuals with PDE, although these metabolites are
  unstable at room temperature (RT) limiting their utility for newborn screening.
  As a result, we sought to identify a biomarker that could be applied to current
  newborn screening paradigms. We identified a novel metabolite, 6-oxo-pipecolate
  (6-oxo-PIP), which accumulates in substantial amounts in blood, plasma, urine, and
  cerebral spinal fluid of individuals with PDE. Using a stable isotope-labeled internal
  standard, we developed a nonderivatized liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based
  method to quantify 6-oxo-PIP. This method replicates the analytical techniques used
  in many laboratories and could be used with few modifications in newborn screening
  programs. Furthermore, 6-oxo-PIP was measurable in urine for 4 months even when
  stored at RT. Herein, we report a novel biomarker for PDE that is stable at RT and
  can be quantified using current newborn screening techniques.
