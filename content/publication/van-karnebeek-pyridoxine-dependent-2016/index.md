abstract: "BACKGROUND: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a rare autosomal recessive
  epileptic encephalopathy caused by antiquitin (ALDH7A1) deficiency. In spite of
  adequate seizure control, 75% of patients suffer intellectual developmental disability.
  Antiquitin deficiency affects lysine catabolism resulting in accumulation of α-aminoadipic
  semialdehyde/pyrroline 6' carboxylate and pipecolic acid. Beside neonatal refractory
  epileptic encephalopathy, numerous neurological manifestations and metabolic/biochemical
  findings have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a phenotypic spectrum
  of antiquitin deficiency based on a literature review (2006 to 2015) of reports
  (n = 49) describing the clinical presentation of confirmed patients (n textgreater 200)
  and a further six patient vignettes. Possible presentations include perinatal asphyxia;
  neonatal withdrawal syndrome; sepsis; enterocolitis; hypoglycemia; neuroimaging
  abnormalities (corpus callosum and cerebellar abnormalities, hemorrhage, white matter
  lesions); biochemical abnormalities (lactic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances,
  neurotransmitter abnormalities); and seizure response to pyridoxine, pyridoxal-phosphate,
  and folinic acid dietary interventions. DISCUSSION: The phenotypic spectrum of pyridoxine-dependent
  epilepsy is wide, including a myriad of neurological and systemic symptoms. Its
  hallmark feature is refractory seizures during the first year of life. Given its
  amenability to treatment with lysine-lowering strategies in addition to pyridoxine
  supplementation for optimal seizure control and developmental outcomes, early diagnosis
  of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is essential. All infants presenting with unexplained
  seizures should be screened for antiquitin deficiency by determination of α-aminoadipic
  semialdehyde/pyrroline 6' carboxylate (in urine, plasma or cerebrospinal fluid)
  and ALDH7A1 molecular analysis."
