abstract: "BACKGROUND: As severe obesity continues to rise among youth, metabolic
  and bariatric surgery (MBS) will increasingly be used as a treatment of choice for
  durable weight loss and improvement of obesity-related complications. MBS for youth
  with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and for preadolescents has
  raised ethical questions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to present
  the creation and application of an ethical framework that supports why MBS should
  be considered in pediatrics based on the principle of justice without automatic
  exclusions. This framework also provides a guide for how to conduct a robust, ethically
  grounded evaluation of pediatric patients presenting for MBS in general, and among
  subpopulations including youth with IDD and preadolescents. SETTING: Academic medical
  center, United States. METHODS: An ethical framework was developed and applied through
  a collaboration between an MBS center at a children's hospital and the institution's
  ethics consult service. RESULTS: Application of the ethical framework to address
  4 core ethical questions is illustrated using 2 hypothetical cases: 1 that highlights
  an adolescent with IDD and 1 that highlights a preadolescent. CONCLUSIONS: We have
  demonstrated the application of a novel, overarching framework to conduct the ethical
  evaluation of youth presenting for MBS. This framework resulted from a collaboration
  between MBS and ethics consult teams and has the potential to be used as a prototype
  for other youth-focused MBS programs. Next steps include prospective data collection
  to test the framework and determine its validity in the target population."
