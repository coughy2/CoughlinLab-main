abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1) is an autosomal recessive condition
  due to a deficiency of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is a key
  enzyme in lysine oxidation. PDE-ALDH7A1 is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
  that was historically and empirically treated with pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine.
  Despite adequate seizure control, most patients with PDE-ALDH7A1 were reported to
  have developmental delay and intellectual disability. To improve outcome, a lysine-restricted
  diet and competitive inhibition of lysine transport through the use of pharmacologic
  doses of arginine have been recommended as an adjunct therapy. These lysine-reduction
  therapies have resulted in improved biochemical parameters and cognitive development
  in many but not all patients. The goal of these consensus guidelines is to re-evaluate
  and update the two previously published recommendations for diagnosis, treatment,
  and follow-up of patients with PDE-ALDH7A1. Members of the International PDE Consortium
  initiated evidence and consensus-based process to review previous recommendations,
  new research findings, and relevant clinical aspects of PDE-ALDH7A1. The guideline
  development group included pediatric neurologists, biochemical geneticists, clinical
  geneticists, laboratory scientists, and metabolic dieticians representing 29 institutions
  from 16 countries. Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients
  with PDE-ALDH7A1 are provided.
