 abstract = {Historically, both pretest and posttest genetic counseling has been standard of care for genetic testing. This model should be adapted for primary care providers (PCPs) willing to learn critical information about the test and key concepts that patients need to make an informed testing decision. It is helpful for PCPs to discuss a few initial patients with a genetic counselor to prepare for the key concepts of pretest and posttest counseling. This article provides guidance about the recommended level of involvement of PCPs based on the test indication, test complexity, disorder management, and the potential for psychosocial sequela.},
