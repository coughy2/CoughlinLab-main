 abstract = {ALDH7A1 deficiency is an epileptic encephalopathy whose seizures respond to treatment with supraphysiological doses of pyridoxine. It arises as a result of damaging variants in ALDH7A1, a gene in the lysine catabolism pathway. α-Aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA) and Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C), which accumulate because of the block in the lysine pathway, are diagnostic biomarkers for this disorder. Recently, it has been reported that 6-oxo-pipecolic acid (6-oxo-PIP) also accumulates in the urine, CSF and plasma of ALDH7A1-deficient individuals and that, given its improved stability, it may be a more suitable biomarker for this disorder. This study measured 6-oxo-PIP in urine from a cohort of 30 patients where α-AASA was elevated and showed that it was above the normal range in all those above 6 months of age. However, 6-oxo-PIP levels were within the normal range in 33% of the patients below 6 months of age. Levels increased with age and correlated with a decrease in α-AASA levels. Longitudinal analysis of urine samples from ALDH7A1-deficient patients who were on a lysine restricted diet whilst receiving supraphysiological doses of pyridoxine showed that levels of 6-oxo-PIP remained elevated whilst α-AASA decreased. Similar to α-AASA, we found that elevated urinary excretion of 6-oxo-PIP can also occur in individuals with molybdenum cofactor deficiency. This study demonstrates that urinary 6-oxo-PIP may not be a suitable biomarker for ALDH7A1 deficiency in neonates. However, further studies are needed to understand the biochemistry leading to its accumulation and its potential long-term side effects.},
