abstract: We present a neonate with molybdenum cofactor deficiency imaged at presentation
  during the first month of life and at 5 months with diffusion-weighted brain MRI.
  While the imaging features of this disease have previously been reported, this case
  highlights a distinctive initial pattern of widespread restricted diffusion involving
  cortex at the depths of sulci. Other case series have published diffusion-weighted
  images (DWI) with this pattern but never specifically commented on this finding.
  This distinct DWI pattern also accounts for the configuration of ulegyria frequently
  described on later imaging. Early recognition of this unique initial DWI pattern
  could avoid misdiagnosis and better direct counseling and management.
