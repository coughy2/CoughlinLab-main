abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH, encoded by ECHS1) catalyzes
  hydration of 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs to 3(S)-hydroxy-acyl-CoAs. SCEH has a broad substrate
  specificity and is believed to play an important role in mitochondrial fatty acid
  oxidation and in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Recently, the first
  patients with SCEH deficiency have been reported revealing only a defect in valine
  catabolism. We investigated the role of SCEH in fatty acid and branched-chain amino
  acid metabolism in four newly identified patients. In addition, because of the Leigh-like
  presentation, we studied enzymes involved in bioenergetics. METHODS: Metabolite,
  enzymatic, protein and genetic analyses were performed in four patients, including
  two siblings. Palmitate loading studies in fibroblasts were performed to study mitochondrial
  β-oxidation. In addition, enoyl-CoA hydratase activity was measured with crotonyl-CoA,
  methacrylyl-CoA, tiglyl-CoA and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA both in fibroblasts and liver
  to further study the role of SCEH in different metabolic pathways. Analyses of pyruvate
  dehydrogenase and respiratory chain complexes were performed in multiple tissues
  of two patients. RESULTS: All patients were either homozygous or compound heterozygous
  for mutations in the ECHS1 gene, had markedly reduced SCEH enzymatic activity and
  protein level in fibroblasts. All patients presented with lactic acidosis. The first
  two patients presented with vacuolating leukoencephalopathy and basal ganglia abnormalities.
  The third patient showed a slow neurodegenerative condition with global brain atrophy
  and the fourth patient showed Leigh-like lesions with a single episode of metabolic
  acidosis. Clinical picture and metabolite analysis were not consistent with a mitochondrial
  fatty acid oxidation disorder, which was supported by the normal palmitate loading
  test in fibroblasts. Patient fibroblasts displayed deficient hydratase activity
  with different substrates tested. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was markedly reduced
  in particular in muscle from the most severely affected patients, which was caused
  by reduced expression of E2 protein, whereas E2 mRNA was increased. CONCLUSIONS:
  Despite its activity towards substrates from different metabolic pathways, SCEH
  appears to be only crucial in valine metabolism, but not in isoleucine metabolism,
  and only of limited importance for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In severely
  affected patients SCEH deficiency can cause a secondary pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency
  contributing to the clinical presentation.'
