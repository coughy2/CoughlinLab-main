abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive or X-linked inborn errors of intracellular
  cobalamin metabolism can lead to methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria. In neonates,
  both increased cerebrospinal fluid glycine and cerebrospinal fluid/plasma glycine
  ratio are biochemical features of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. METHODS: We describe
  a boy presenting in the neonatal period with hypotonia, tonic, clonic, and later
  myoclonic seizures, subsequently evolving into refractory epilepsy and severe neurocognitive
  impairment. RESULTS: Increased cerebrospinal fluid glycine and cerebrospinal fluid
  to plasma glycine ratio were indicative of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Early magnetic
  resonance imaging showed restricted diffusion and decreased apparent diffusion coefficient values
  in posterior limb of internal capsules and later in entire internal capsules and
  posterior white matter. Sequencing did not show a mutation in AMT, GLDC, or GCSH.
  Biochemical analysis identified persistently increased cerebrospinal fluid levels
  of glycine and methylmalonic acid and increased urinary methylmalonic acid and plasma
  homocysteine levels, which improved on higher parenteral hydroxocobalamin dose.
  Exome sequencing identified a known pathogenic sequence variant in X-linked cobalamin
  (HCFC1), c.344CtextgreaterT, p. Ala115Val. In addition, a hemizygous mutation was
  found in the ATRX (c. 2728AtextgreaterG, p. Lys910Glu). Retrospective review of
  two other patients with X-linked cobalamin deficiency also identified increased
  cerebrospinal fluid glycine levels. CONCLUSIONS: This boy had X-linked cobalamin
  deficiency (HCFC1) with increased cerebrospinal fluid glycine and methylmalonic
  acid and increased cerebrospinal fluid to plasma glycine ratio suggesting a brain
  hyperglycinemia. Putative binding sites for HCFC1 and its binding partner THAP11
  were identified near genes of the glycine cleavage enzyme, providing a potential
  mechanistic link between HCFC1 mutations and increased glycine.'
