abstract: Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE) is a treatable epileptic encephalopathy
  characterized by a positive response to pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine. Despite
  seizure control, at least 75% of individuals have intellectual disability and developmental
  delay. Current treatment paradigms have resulted in improved cognitive outcomes
  emphasizing the importance of an early diagnosis. As genetic testing is increasingly
  accepted as first tier testing for epileptic encephalopathies, we aimed to provide
  a comprehensive overview of ALDH7A1 mutations that cause PDE. The genotypes, ethnic
  origin and reported gender was collected from 185 subjects with a diagnosis of PDE.
  The population frequency for the variants in this report and the existing literature
  were reviewed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Novel variants identified
  in population databases were also evaluated through in silico prediction software
  and select variants were over-expressed in an E.coli-based expression system to
  measure α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity and production of α-aminoadipic
  acid. This study adds 47 novel variants to the literature resulting in a total of
  165 reported pathogenic variants. Based on this report, in silico predictions, and
  general population data, we estimate an incidence of approximately 1:64,352 live
  births. This report provides a comprehensive overview of known ALDH7A1 mutations
  that cause PDE, and suggests that PDE may be more common than initially estimated.
  Due to the relative high frequency of the disease, the likelihood of under-diagnosis
  given the wide clinical spectrum and limited awareness among clinicians as well
  as the cognitive improvement noted with early treatment, newborn screening for PDE
  may be warranted.
