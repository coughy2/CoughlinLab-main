abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Seventy-five percent of patients with pyridoxine-dependent
  epilepsy (PDE) due to Antiquitin (ATQ) deficiency suffer from developmental delay
  and/or intellectual disability (IQ textless 70) despite seizure control. An observational
  study showed that adjunct treatment with a lysine-restricted diet is safe, results
  in partial normalization of lysine intermediates in body fluids, and may have beneficial
  effects on seizure control and psychomotor development. METHODS: In analogy to the
  NICE guideline process, the international PDE Consortium, an open platform uniting
  scientists and clinicians working in the field of this metabolic epilepsy, during
  four workshops (2010-2013) developed a recommendation for a lysine-restricted diet
  in PDE, with the aim of standardizing its implementation and monitoring of patients.
  Additionally, a proposal for a further observational study is suggested. RESULTS:
  (1) All patients with confirmed ATQ deficiency are eligible for adjunct treatment
  with lysine-restricted diet, unless treatment with pyridoxine alone has resulted
  in complete symptom resolution, including normal behavior and development. (2) Lysine
  restriction should be started as early as possible; the optimal duration remains
  undetermined. (3) The diet should be implemented and the patient be monitored according
  to these recommendations in order to assure best possible quality of care and safety.
  DISCUSSION: The implementation of this recommendation will provide a unique and
  a much needed opportunity to gather data with which to refine the recommendation
  as well as improve our understanding of outcomes of individuals affected by this
  rare disease. We therefore propose an international observational study that would
  utilize freely accessible, online data sharing technologies to generate more evidence.'
