 abstract = {Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. Most cases are due to mutations in an X-linked PDHA1 gene encoding the E1alpha subunit of the multienzyme complex. Females with mutations in the PDHA1 gene may be asymptomatic or have a milder phenotype as a result of skewed X-inactivation, while males are typically more severely affected. We report a case of PDHA1 mosaicism in a male patient who had a milder phenotype.},
