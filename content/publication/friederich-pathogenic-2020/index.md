abstract: Hydrogen sulfide, a signaling molecule formed mainly from cysteine, is catabolized
  by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (gene SQOR). Toxic hydrogen sulfide exposure inhibits
  complex IV. We describe children of two families with pathogenic variants in SQOR.
  Exome sequencing identified variants; SQOR enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically,
  protein levels evaluated by western blotting, and mitochondrial function was assayed.
  In family A, following a brief illness, a 4-year-old girl presented comatose with
  lactic acidosis and multiorgan failure. After stabilization, she remained comatose,
  hypotonic, had neurostorming episodes, elevated lactate, and Leigh-like lesions
  on brain imaging. She died shortly after. Her 8-year-old sister presented with a
  rapidly fatal episode of coma with lactic acidosis, and lesions in the basal ganglia
  and left cortex. Muscle and liver tissue had isolated decreased complex IV activity,
  but normal complex IV protein levels and complex formation. Both patients were homozygous
  for c.637G textgreater A, which we identified as a founder mutation in the Lehrerleut
  Hutterite with a carrier frequency of 1 in 13. The resulting p.Glu213Lys change
  disrupts hydrogen bonding with neighboring residues, resulting in severely reduced
  SQOR protein and enzyme activity, whereas sulfide generating enzyme levels were
  unchanged. In family B, a boy had episodes of encephalopathy and basal ganglia lesions.
  He was homozygous for c.446delT and had severely reduced fibroblast SQOR enzyme
  activity and protein levels. SQOR dysfunction can result in hydrogen sulfide accumulation,
  which, consistent with its known toxicity, inhibits complex IV resulting in energy
  failure. In conclusion, SQOR deficiency represents a new, potentially treatable,
  cause of Leigh disease.
