abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized
  by response to pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine. PDE is caused by deficiency of
  α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase resulting in impaired lysine degradation
  and subsequent accumulation of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde. Despite adequate seizure
  control with pyridoxine monotherapy, 75% of individuals with PDE have significant
  developmental delay and intellectual disability. We describe a new combined therapeutic
  approach to reduce putative toxic metabolites from impaired lysine metabolism. This
  approach utilizes pyridoxine, a lysine-restricted diet to limit the substrate that
  leads to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation and L-arginine to compete for brain
  lysine influx and liver mitochondrial import. We report the developmental and biochemical
  outcome of six subjects who were treated with this triple therapy. Triple therapy
  reduced CSF, plasma, and urine biomarkers associated with neurotoxicity in PDE.
  The addition of arginine supplementation to children already treated with dietary
  lysine restriction and pyridoxine further reduced toxic metabolites, and in some
  subjects appeared to improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Dietary lysine restriction
  was associated with improved seizure control in one subject, and the addition of
  arginine supplementation increased the objective motor outcome scale in two twin
  siblings, illustrating the contribution of each component of this treatment combination.
  Optimal results were noted in the individual treated with triple therapy early in
  the course of the disease. Residual disease symptoms could be related to early injury
  suggested by initial MR imaging prior to initiation of treatment or from severe
  epilepsy prior to diagnosis. This observational study reports the use of triple
  therapy, which combines three effective components in this rare condition, and suggests
  that early diagnosis and treatment with this new triple therapy may ameliorate the
  cognitive impairment in PDE.
