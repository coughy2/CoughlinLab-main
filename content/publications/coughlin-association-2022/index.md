abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1)
  is a developmental epileptic encephalopathy characterized by seizure improvement
  after pyridoxine supplementation. Adjunct lysine reduction therapies (LRTs) reduce
  the accumulation of putative neurotoxic metabolites with the goal to improve developmental
  outcomes. Our objective was to examine the association between treatment with LRTs
  and cognitive outcomes. METHODS: Participants were recruited from within the International
  Registry for Patients with Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy from August 2014 through
  March 2021. The primary outcome was standardized developmental test scores associated
  with overall cognitive ability. The relationship between test scores and treatment
  was analyzed with multivariable linear regression using a mixed-effects model. A
  priori, we hypothesized that treatment in early infancy with pyridoxine and LRTs
  would result in a normal developmental outcome. A subanalysis was performed to evaluate
  the association between cognitive outcome and LRTs initiated in the first 6 months
  of life. RESULTS: A total of 112 test scores from 60 participants were available.
  On average, treatment with pyridoxine and LRTs was associated with a nonsignificant
  increase of 6.9 points (95% CI -2.7 to 16.5) on developmental testing compared with
  treatment with pyridoxine alone. For the subanalysis, a total of 14 developmental
  testing scores were available from 8 participants. On average, treatment with pyridoxine
  and LRTs in the first 6 months of life was associated with a significant increase
  of 21.9 points (95% CI 1.7-42.0) on developmental testing. DISCUSSION: Pyridoxine
  and LRTs at any age was associated with mild improvement in developmental testing,
  and treatment in early infancy was associated with a clinically significant increase
  in developmental test scores. These results provide insight into the mechanism of
  intellectual and developmental disability in PDE-ALDH7A1 and emphasize the importance
  of treatment in early infancy with both pyridoxine and LRTs. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:
  This study provides Class IV evidence that in PDE-ALDH7A1, pyridoxine and LRTs compared
  with pyridoxine alone is not significantly associated with overall higher developmental
  testing scores, but treatment in the first 6 months of life is associated with significantly
  higher developmental testing scores.'
