abstract: Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is a clinically heterogeneous
  disorder. Most cases are due to mutations in an X-linked PDHA1 gene encoding the
  E1alpha subunit of the multienzyme complex. Females with mutations in the PDHA1
  gene may be asymptomatic or have a milder phenotype as a result of skewed X-inactivation,
  while males are typically more severely affected. We report a case of PDHA1 mosaicism
  in a male patient who had a milder phenotype.
