abstract: "PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to delineate the genetic mutations that
  cause classic nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). METHODS: Genetic results, parental
  phase, ethnic origin, and gender data were collected from subjects suspected to
  have classic NKH. Mutations were compared with those in the existing literature
  and to the population frequency from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database.
  RESULTS: In 578 families, genetic analyses identified 410 unique mutations, including
  246 novel mutations. 80% of subjects had mutations in GLDC. Missense mutations were
  noted in 52% of all GLDC alleles, most private. Missense mutations were 1.5 times
  as likely to be pathogenic in the carboxy terminal of GLDC than in the amino-terminal
  part. Intragenic copy-number variations (CNVs) in GLDC were noted in 140 subjects,
  with biallelic CNVs present in 39 subjects. The position and frequency of the breakpoint
  for CNVs correlated with intron size and presence of Alu elements. Missense mutations,
  most often recurring, were the most common type of disease-causing mutation in AMT.
  Sequencing and CNV analysis identified biallelic pathogenic mutations in 98% of
  subjects. Based on genotype, 15% of subjects had an attenuated phenotype. The frequency
  of NKH is estimated at 1:76,000. CONCLUSION: The 484 unique mutations now known
  in classic NKH provide a valuable overview for the development of genotype-based
  therapies.Genet Med 19 1, 104-111."
