abstract: Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare cause of heart muscle disease
  with the highest mortality rate among cardiomyopathy types. The etiology of RCM
  is poorly understood, although genetic causes have been implicated, and syndromic
  associations have been described. Here, we describe a patient with an atrial septal
  defect and restrictive cardiomyopathy along with craniofacial anomalies and intellectual
  disabilities. Initial screening using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) identified
  a maternally inherited 2q13 microdeletion. The patient had many of the features
  reported in previous cases with the recurrent 2q13 microdeletion syndrome. However,
  the inheritance of the microdeletion from an unaffected mother combined with the
  low incidence (10%) and milder forms of cardiac defects in previously reported cases
  made the clinical significance of the CMA results unclear. Whole-exome sequencing
  (WES) with trio-based analysis was performed and identified a paternally inherited
  TMEM87B mutation (c.1366AtextgreaterG, p.Asn456Asp) in the patient. TMEM87B, a highly
  conserved, transmembrane protein of currently unknown function, lies within the
  critical region of the recurrent 2q13 microdeletion syndrome. Furthermore, a recent
  study had demonstrated that depletion of TMEM87B in zebrafish embryos affected cardiac
  development and led to cardiac hypoplasia. Thus, by combining CMA and WES, we potentially
  uncover an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a severe cardiac phenotype
  caused by mutations in TMEM87B. This study expands the spectrum of phenotypes associated
  with the recurrent 2q13 microdeletion syndrome and also further suggests the role
  of TMEM87B in its etiology, especially the cardiac pathology.
