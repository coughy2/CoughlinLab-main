abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial disease is often suspected in cases of severe
  epileptic encephalopathy especially when a complex movement disorder, liver involvement
  and progressive developmental regression are present. Although mutations in either
  mitochondrial DNA or POLG are often present, other nuclear defects in mitochondrial
  DNA replication and protein translation have been associated with a severe epileptic
  encephalopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a proband with an epileptic encephalopathy,
  complex movement disorder and a combined mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme
  deficiency. The child presented with neurological regression, complex movement disorder
  and intractable seizures. A combined deficiency of mitochondrial complexes I, III
  and IV was noted in liver tissue, along with increased mitochondrial DNA content
  in skeletal muscle. Incomplete assembly of complex V, using blue native polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoretic analysis and complex I, using western blotting, suggested a
  disorder of mitochondrial transcription or translation. Exome sequencing identified
  compound heterozygous mutations in CARS2, a mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.
  Both mutations affect highly conserved amino acids located within the functional
  ligase domain of the cysteinyl-tRNA synthase. A specific decrease in the amount
  of charged mt-tRNA(Cys) was detected in patient fibroblasts compared with controls.
  Retroviral transfection of the wild-type CARS2 into patient skin fibroblasts led
  to the correction of the incomplete assembly of complex V, providing functional
  evidence for the role of CARS2 mutations in disease aetiology. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  findings indicate that mutations in CARS2 result in a mitochondrial translational
  defect as seen in individuals with mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy.'
