abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Seventy-five percent of patients with pyridoxine-dependent
  epilepsy due to α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (PDE-ALDH7A1)
  suffer intellectual developmental disability despite pyridoxine treatment. Adjunct
  lysine reduction therapies (LRT), aimed at lowering putative neurotoxic metabolites,
  are associated with improved cognitive outcomes. However, possibly due to timing
  of treatment, not all patients have normal intellectual function. METHODS: This
  retrospective, multi-center cohort study evaluated the effect of timing of pyridoxine
  monotherapy and pyridoxine with adjunct LRT on neurodevelopmental outcome. Patients
  with confirmed PDE-ALDH7A1 with at least one sibling with PDE-ALDH7A1 and a difference
  in age at treatment initiation were eligible and identified via the international
  PDE registry, resulting in thirty-seven patients of 18 families. Treatment regimen
  was pyridoxine monotherapy in ten families and pyridoxine with adjunct LRT in the
  other eight. Primary endpoints were standardized and clinically assessed neurodevelopmental
  outcomes. Clinical neurodevelopmental status was subjectively assessed over seven
  domains: overall neurodevelopment, speech/language, cognition, fine and gross motor
  skills, activities of daily living and behavioral/psychiatric abnormalities. RESULTS:
  The majority of early treated siblings on pyridoxine monotherapy performed better
  than their late treated siblings on the clinically assessed domain of fine motor
  skills. For siblings on pyridoxine and adjunct LRT, the majority of early treated
  siblings performed better on clinically assessed overall neurodevelopment, cognition,
  and behavior/psychiatry. Fourteen percent of the total cohort was assessed as normal
  on all domains. CONCLUSION: Early treatment with pyridoxine and adjunct LRT may
  be beneficial for neurodevelopmental outcome. When evaluating a more extensive neurodevelopmental
  assessment, the actual impairment rate may be higher than the 75% reported in literature.
  TAKE- HOME MESSAGE: Early initiation of lysine reduction therapies adjunct to pyridoxine
  treatment in patients with PDE-ALDH7A1 may result in an improved neurodevelopmental
  outcome.'
