abstract: Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract can be associated with
  Hirschsprung disease. We report on three children with a similar 16p11.2 microdeletion
  with a spectrum of clinical anomalies consisting of congenital anomalies of the
  kidney and urinary tract in two patients (Patients 1 and 2) and Hirschsprung disease
  in two patients (Patients 1 and 3), leading us to hypothesize that a gene in this
  region is associated with these phenotypes. Patient 1 presented with left renal
  agenesis, grade-IV vesicoureteral reflux, and Hirschsprung disease, Patient 2 with
  left renal agenesis, chronic kidney disease, chronic constipation, seizures, and
  developmental delay, and Patient 3 with Hirschsprung disease and normal kidneys.
  Genome-wide microarray analysis demonstrated overlapping microdeletions within 16p11.2.
  The shortest region of overlap in the three patients contained only eight genes,
  including the SH2 domain-containing binding protein 1 (SH2B1), an adaptor protein
  which has been implicated in enhancement of the tyrosine kinase activity of RET,
  whose role in developmental disease of the kidney and enteric enervation is well
  established. Our findings suggest that 16p11.2 deletions are associated with abnormalities
  of renal and enteric development and we hypothesize that deletion of SH2B1 may account
  for the observed phenotype.
