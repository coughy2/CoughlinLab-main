abstract: We describe a neonate and a 14-month-old child presenting with seizures
  that were not (completely) controlled with antiepileptic medications. There were
  no signs of infection, and electrolytes and neuroimaging were normal. In the neonate,
  pyridoxine was administered followed by cessation of seizures, and a diagnosis of
  pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1, a neurometabolic disorder of lysine
  metabolism) was genetically confirmed. The 14-month-old child received a genetic
  diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1 after abnormalities in the metabolic investigations. Both
  children were treated with pyridoxine and adjunct lysine reduction therapy (LRT).
  Seizures were controlled completely, but both children are developmentally delayed.
  During her second pregnancy, the mother of the neonate was started on pyridoxine
  treatment because of the risk of PDE-ALDH7A1. After delivery, pyridoxine treatment
  was continued in the neonate, who did not show any clinical symptoms. Molecular
  analysis identified the familial variants consistent with the diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1.
  Adjunct LRT was initiated. This child has never experienced seizures, and development
  has been completely normal thus far (age 2.9 years), despite the shared genotype
  with their sibling with developmental delays (DDs). In conclusion, in neonates,
  infants, and children presenting with seizures of unknown origin with partial or
  no response to common antiepileptic medications, the diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1 or
  other pyridoxine-responsive genetic epilepsies should be considered, prompting a
  trial of pyridoxine as \"diagnostic therapeuticum.\" The digital application Treatable-ID
  (treatable-id.org) can support clinicians in the early diagnosis of treatable conditions
  in patients presenting with DD/intellectual disability of unknown cause.
