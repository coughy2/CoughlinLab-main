abstract: 'PURPOSE: In response to genetic testing being widely ordered by nongenetics
  clinicians, the Consent and Disclosure Recommendations (CADRe) Workgroup of the
  Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen; clinicalgenome.org ) developed guidance to facilitate
  communication about genetic testing and efficiently improve the patient experience.
  Considering ethical, legal, and social implications, and medical factors, CADRe
  developed and pilot tested two rubrics addressing consent for genetic testing and
  results disclosure. The CADRe rubrics allow for adjusting the communication approach
  based on circumstances specific to patients and ordering clinicians. METHODS: We
  present results of a formative survey of 66 genetics clinicians to assess the consent
  rubric for nine genes (MLH1, CDH1, TP53, GJB2, OTC; DMD, HTT, and CYP2C9/VKORC1).
  We also conducted interviews and focus groups with family and patient stakeholders
  (N = 18), nongenetics specialists (N = 27), and genetics clinicians (N = 32) on
  both rubrics. RESULTS: Formative evaluation of the CADRe rubrics suggests key factors
  on which to make decisions about consent and disclosure discussions for a \"typical\"
  patient. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CADRe rubrics include the primary issues
  necessary to guide communication recommendations, and are ready for pilot testing
  by nongenetics clinicians. Consultation with genetics clinicians can be targeted
  toward more complex or intensive consent and disclosure counseling.'
