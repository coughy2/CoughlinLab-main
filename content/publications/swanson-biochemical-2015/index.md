abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a neurometabolic disorder characterized
  by intellectual disability, seizures, and spasticity. Patients with attenuated nonketotic
  hyperglycinemia make variable developmental progress. Predictive factors have not
  been systematically assessed. METHODS: We reviewed 124 patients stratified by developmental
  outcome for biochemical and molecular predictive factors. Missense mutations were
  expressed to quantify residual activity using a new assay. RESULTS: Patients with
  severe nonketotic hyperglycinemia required multiple anticonvulsants, whereas patients
  with developmental quotient (DQ) textgreater 30 did not require anticonvulsants.
  Brain malformations occurred mainly in patients with severe nonketotic hyperglycinemia
  (71%) but rarely in patients with attenuated nonketotic hyperglycinemia (7.5%).
  Neonatal presentation did not correlate with outcome, but age at onset ≥ 4 months
  was associated with attenuated nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
  glycine levels and CSF:plasma glycine ratio correlated inversely with DQ; CSF glycine textgreater 230
  μM indicated severe outcome and CSF:plasma glycine ratio ≤ 0.08 predicted attenuated
  outcome. The glycine index correlated strongly with outcome. Molecular analysis
  identified 99% of mutant alleles, including 96 novel mutations. Mutations near the
  active cleft of the P-protein maintained stable protein levels. Presence of 1 mutation
  with residual activity was necessary but not sufficient for attenuated outcome;
  2 such mutations conferred best outcome. Divergent outcomes for the same genotype
  indicate a contribution of other genetic or nongenetic factors. INTERPRETATION:
  Accurate prediction of outcome is possible in most patients. A combination of 4
  factors available neonatally predicted 78% of severe and 49% of attenuated patients,
  and a score based on mutation severity predicted outcome with 70% sensitivity and
  97% specificity.'
