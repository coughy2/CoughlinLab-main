abstract: Patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia and deficient glycine cleavage
  enzyme activity, but without mutations in AMT, GLDC or GCSH, the genes encoding
  its constituent proteins, constitute a clinical group which we call 'variant nonketotic
  hyperglycinemia'. We hypothesize that in some patients the aetiology involves genetic
  mutations that result in a deficiency of the cofactor lipoate, and sequenced genes
  involved in lipoate synthesis and iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis. Of 11 individuals
  identified with variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia, we were able to determine the
  genetic aetiology in eight patients and delineate the clinical and biochemical phenotypes.
  Mutations were identified in the genes for lipoate synthase (LIAS), BolA type 3
  (BOLA3), and a novel gene glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5). Patients with GLRX5-associated
  variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia had normal development with childhood-onset spastic
  paraplegia, spinal lesion, and optic atrophy. Clinical features of BOLA3-associated
  variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia include severe neurodegeneration after a period
  of normal development. Additional features include leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy
  and optic atrophy. Patients with lipoate synthase-deficient variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia
  varied in severity from mild static encephalopathy to Leigh disease and cortical
  involvement. All patients had high serum and borderline elevated cerebrospinal fluid
  glycine and cerebrospinal fluid:plasma glycine ratio, and deficient glycine cleavage
  enzyme activity. They had low pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity but most did
  not have lactic acidosis. Patients were deficient in lipoylation of mitochondrial
  proteins. There were minimal and inconsistent changes in cellular iron handling,
  and respiratory chain activity was unaffected. Identified mutations were phylogenetically
  conserved, and transfection with native genes corrected the biochemical deficiency
  proving pathogenicity. Treatments of cells with lipoate and with mitochondrially-targeted
  lipoate were unsuccessful at correcting the deficiency. The recognition of variant
  nonketotic hyperglycinemia is important for physicians evaluating patients with
  abnormalities in glycine as this will affect the genetic causation and genetic counselling,
  and provide prognostic information on the expected phenotypic course.
