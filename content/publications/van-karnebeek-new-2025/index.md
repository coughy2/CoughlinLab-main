abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) due to recessive ALDH7A1 mutations is
  characterized by intractable epilepsy that is often unresponsive to antiseizure
  medications. Irrespective of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation and lysine
  reduction therapy, patients present severe residual neurocognitive deficits. We
  evaluated upstream inhibition of 2-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS) as a
  novel therapeutic strategy to reduce the accumulating metabolites (α-aminoadipic
  semialdehyde, Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylate, pipecolic acid, 6-oxo-pipecolic acid
  and 2S,6S-/2s,6R-oxopropylpiperidine-2-carboxylic acid) considered neurotoxic. We
  utilized an existing mouse knockout model of hyperlysinaemia (Aass-knockout) and
  generated a PDE model, a Aldh7a1 single knockout model via CRISPR/Cas (clustered
  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein) and
  generated the double-knockout Aass/Aldh7a1 mice. Next-generation metabolomics screening
  was performed to measure all known biomarkers in brain, liver and plasma of wild-type
  and mutant mice. Metabolomics confirmed the known metabolite markers for Aldh7a1-knockout
  and Aass knockout mice in all samples. The potentially neurotoxic metabolites (Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylate,
  pipecolic acid, 6-oxo-pipecolic acid and 2S,6S-/2s,6R-oxopropylpiperidine-2-carboxylic
  acid) significantly decreased in double-knockout Aass/Aldh7a1 mice brain and liver
  tissues compared to Aldh7a1-knockout mice. Plasma analysis revealed a significant
  reduction of known biomarkers, suggesting a reliable monitoring option in human
  patients. We demonstrate the first mammalian evidence that AASS inhibition is a
  viable strategy to rescue abnormal brain metabolism associated with PDE. This may
  target the intellectual disability and neurologic deficits caused by persistent
  lysine catabolic-related neurotoxicity despite adequate vitamin B6 supplementation.
