abstract: 'PURPOSE: Cystinuria, an inherited defect of dibasic amino acid transport,
  causes accumulation of urinary cystine and cystine urolithiasis. In adults penicillamine
  reduces stone formation but has a high incidence of dose limiting toxicity. We evaluated
  the effects of penicillamine in preventing stone formation and with respect to toxicity
  in our cystinuria cohort at a pediatric biochemical genetics clinic. MATERIALS AND
  METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all 11 children with cystinuria treated at our
  clinic using a gradual dose escalation of penicillamine. Mean +/- SD patient age
  at diagnosis was 5.8 +/- 4.3 years (range 1.2 to 12). We tracked urinary cystine
  concentration before and after initiation of treatment, penicillamine side effects
  and incidence of new stones during maintenance therapy. RESULTS: During the gradual
  escalation of penicillamine to the target dose none of the 11 patients experienced
  toxicity and all had improved urinary cystine concentration (mean +/- SD percent
  reduction 54% +/- 25%, range 5% to 81%). We followed the patients for a total of
  1,203 months (mean +/- SD 109 +/- 73 months, range 41 to 221), periodically assessing
  urinary cystine concentration, urine protein content, complete blood count, blood
  urea nitrogen, creatinine and liver function. During this time only 2 patients experienced
  significant side effects and no patient had stones or stone crises while compliant
  with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort penicillamine was well tolerated after
  gradual initiation and it reduced urinary cystine concentration. Long-term compliance
  with the medication appeared to protect patients from acute stone crises.'
