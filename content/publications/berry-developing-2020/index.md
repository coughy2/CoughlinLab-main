abstract: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the Rare Diseases Clinical
  Research Network to address the unique challenges of performing research on rare
  diseases. The Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium (UCDC) was one of the original ten
  consortia established. The UCDC represents a unique partnership among clinicians,
  patients, and the NIH with a primary goal of increasing the development of therapeutics
  that improve patient outcomes for persons affected with a UCD. Based in part on
  financial incentives associated with the Orphan Drug Act biopharmaceutical and investment
  entities have an intense interest in engaging with research consortia like the UCDC,
  which have compiled potentially valuable longitudinal data characterizing outcomes
  in a relatively large number of affected individuals. We describe the UCDC experience
  and the bases for evaluating partnerships with such private entities. We review
  early industry interactions, the development of policies and procedures, and describe
  the establishment of an Industry Relations Committee, including guiding principles.
  Challenges encountered, particularly in the transition when products are approved,
  and potential solutions are discussed. By building a framework for industry partnerships
  that guides us in resolving inevitable challenges, we can enthusiastically pursue
  novel and promising collaborations that can lead to breakthroughs in therapeutic
  interventions for patients.
