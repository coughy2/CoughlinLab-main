 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Epilepsy is a diverse group of neurological disorders affecting over 
      50 million people worldwide. While common epilepsy types are well studied, rare 
      epilepsies-often severe and genetically complex-pose significant challenges in 
      diagnosis, research, and treatment. Accurate and interoperable etiology and 
      disease classifications are critical for improving data sharing, supporting 
      clinical decision-making, and advancing rare disease research. RESULTS: To 
      enhance the accuracy of epilepsy-related disease concept representation within 
      the Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo), we conducted a series of expert-driven 
      workshops in collaboration with the team from the Rare Disease Cures 
      Accelerator-Data and Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP). Specialists in epileptology, 
      genetics, neurodevelopment, biomedical ontology, and patient community advocates 
      systematically reviewed and revised the epilepsy hierarchy in Mondo, aligning it 
      with the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification system. 
      These updates include reclassification of epilepsy subtypes, including syndromes, 
      age-related epilepsies, and developmental epileptic encephalopathies, resulting 
      in a more granular, standardized, and clinically relevant structure. Mondo now 
      offers an enhanced framework for integrating epilepsy data across resources, 
      enabling improved interoperability and facilitating rare disease research and 
      data curation, with continued efforts underway to further refine and expand this 
      integration.},
