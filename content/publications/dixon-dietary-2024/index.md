abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1) is a neurometabolic disorder
  in the lysine metabolism pathway. In 2014 and 2021, the International PDE consortium
  published consensus guidelines about diagnosis and management. In this follow-on,
  a literature review was performed and nutrition management was evaluated through
  an international dietary questionnaire with 40 respondents. This manuscript discusses
  consensus dietary statements and the practical provision of lysine reduction therapies.
  Results from the questionnaire, statements from the PDE consensus guidelines, new
  data from the literature, as well as clinical practice experience of the metabolic
  dietitian group form the basis of these updated practical diet recommendations.
  These dietary management recommendations can support dietitians, nutritionists,
  and physicians in initiation and monitoring of lysine reduction therapies for PDE-ALDH7A1
  patients and families.
