abstract: "BACKGROUND: Little is known about pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due to
  α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (PDE-ALDH7A1) in adulthood,
  as the genetic basis of the disorder has only been elucidated 15 years ago. This
  creates a knowledge gap for physicians, pediatric patients and their parents, which
  was aimed to address in this study using clinical data as well as patient-reported
  outcome measures (PROMs) for the patient's perspective. METHODS: Dutch, genetically
  confirmed PDE-ALDH7A1 patients ≥18 years were eligible for inclusion. Clinical data
  were collected as well as PROMs (PROMIS item banks Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Physical
  Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, Cognitive Abilities, Ability to Participate
  and Satisfaction with Social Roles). RESULTS: Ten out of 11 patients agreed to participate
  (91% response rate). Seizure control at last follow up (median age 25.2 years, range
  17.8-29.8 years) was achieved with pyridoxine monotherapy in 70%, 20% with adjunct
  common-anti epileptic drugs and 10% did not obtain complete seizure control. Neurologic
  symptoms were present in all but one patient (90%) and included tremors, noted in
  40%. Neuro-imaging abnormalities were present in 80%. Intellectual disability was
  present in 70%. One patient (10%) attended university, three maintained a job without
  assistance, five maintained a job with assistance or attended social daycare, and
  one patient never followed regular education. The cohort scored significantly lower
  on the PROMIS Cognitive Functioning compared to the general (age-related) population.
  Distribution of scores was wide on all PROMIS item banks. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION:
  Outcomes of this young adult cohort are heterogeneous and individualized approaches
  are therefore needed. Long-term seizure control with pyridoxine was achieved for
  almost all patients. Neurologic symptoms were noted in the majority, including tremors,
  as well as neuro-imaging abnormalities and intellectual disability, additionally
  reflected by the PROMIS Cognitive Functioning. PDE-ALDH7A1 patients scored comparable
  to the general population on all other PROMs, especially regarding Ability to Participate
  and Satisfaction with Social Roles this may indicate a positive interpretation of
  their functioning. The aim is to expand this pilot study to larger populations to
  obtain more solid data, and to advance the use of PROMs to engage patients in research
  and provide the opportunity for personalized care."
