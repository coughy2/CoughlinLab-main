abstract: Copy number variation (CNV) analysis has had a major impact on the field
  of medical genetics, providing a mechanism to identify disease-causing genomic alterations
  in an unprecedented number of diseases and phenotypes. CNV analysis is now routinely
  used in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, and has led to a significant increase
  in the detection of chromosomal abnormalities. These findings are used for prenatal
  decision making, clinical management and genetic counseling. Although a powerful
  tool to identify genomic alterations, CNV analysis may also result in the detection
  of genomic alterations that have unknown clinical significance or reveal unintended
  information. This highlights the importance of informed consent and genetic counseling
  for clinical CNV analysis. This review examines the advantages and limitations of
  CNV discovery in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, as well as the impact on the
  clinician and family.
