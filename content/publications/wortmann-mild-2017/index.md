abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Elevated urinary excretion of orotic acid is associated with
  treatable disorders of the urea cycle and pyrimidine metabolism. Establishing the
  correct and timely diagnosis in a patient with orotic aciduria is key to effective
  treatment. Uridine monophosphate synthase is involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis.
  Uridine monophosphate synthase deficiency (or hereditary orotic aciduria), due to
  biallelic mutations in UMPS, is a rare condition presenting with megaloblastic anemia
  in the first months of life. If not treated with the pyrimidine precursor uridine,
  neutropenia, failure to thrive, growth retardation, developmental delay, and intellectual
  disability may ensue. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified mild and isolated orotic
  aciduria in 11 unrelated individuals with diverse clinical signs and symptoms, the
  most common denominator being intellectual disability/developmental delay. Of note,
  none had blood count abnormalities, relevant hyperammonemia or altered plasma amino
  acid profile. All individuals were found to have heterozygous alterations in UMPS.
  Four of these variants were predicted to be null alleles with complete loss of function.
  The remaining variants were missense changes and predicted to be damaging to the
  normal encoded protein. Interestingly, family screening revealed heterozygous UMPS
  variants in combination with mild orotic aciduria in 19 clinically asymptomatic
  family members. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that heterozygous UMPS-mutations
  can lead to mild and isolated orotic aciduria without clinical consequence. Partial
  UMPS-deficiency should be included in the differential diagnosis of mild orotic
  aciduria. The discovery of heterozygotes manifesting clinical symptoms such as hypotonia
  and developmental delay are likely due to ascertainment bias.'
