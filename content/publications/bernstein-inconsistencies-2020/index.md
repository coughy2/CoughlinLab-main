abstract: Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA-1) is a cerebral organic aciduria characterized
  by striatal injury and progressive movement disorder. Nutrition management shifted
  from a general restriction of intact protein to targeted restriction of lysine and
  tryptophan. Recent guidelines advocate for a low-lysine diet using lysine-free,
  tryptophan-reduced medical foods. GA-1 guideline recommendations for dietary management
  of patients over the age of six are unclear, ranging from avoiding excessive intake
  of intact protein to counting milligrams of lysine intake. A 22-question survey
  on the nutrition management of GA-1 was developed with the goal of understanding
  approaches to diet management for patients identified by newborn screening under
  age six years compared to management after diet liberalization, as well as to gain
  insight into how clinicians define diet liberalization. Seventy-six responses (25%
  of possible responses) to the survey were received. Nutrition management with GA-1
  is divergent among surveyed clinicians. There was congruency among survey responses
  to the guidelines, but there is still uncertainty about how to counsel patients
  on diet optimization and when diet liberalization should occur. Ongoing clinical
  research and better understanding of the natural history of this disease will help
  establish stronger recommendations from which clinicians can best counsel families.
