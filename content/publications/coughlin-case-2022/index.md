abstract: Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due to mutations in ALDH7A1 (PDH-ALDH7A1)
  is a highly treatable developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Pharmacologic
  doses of pyridoxine are associated with dramatic clinical seizure improvement, and
  most patients achieve adequate seizure control with pyridoxine alone. Unfortunately,
  some patients with PDE-ALDH7A1 have died prior to when the diagnosis was made and
  subsequent treatment with pyridoxine could be implemented, highlighting the importance
  of a timely diagnosis. Although critical for seizure control, pyridoxine treatment
  alone is not sufficient for normal outcomes as most patients suffer intellectual
  and developmental delay. Adjunct lysine reduction therapies are associated with
  significant developmental improvements, although these treatments have limited efficacy
  if delayed after the first few months of life. Recently two biomarkers were identified
  that overcome previous technical hurdles for newborn screening. Herein we provide
  commentary that PDE-ALDH7A1 meets both current and historic criteria for newborn
  screening, and that a neonatal diagnosis and treatment can both reduce mortality
  from uncontrolled seizures and significantly improve the cognitive delay that is
  pervasive in this treatable disorder.
