        **Ethics and Genetics**
      text: |
        Our ethics research is primarly focused on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genetics and genomics. Dr. Coughlin is a certified health ethics consultant (HEC-C) and also serves as a clinical bioethics.

            We aim to understand the underlying disease mechansim of PDE-ALDH7A1 with a focus on biochemistry. This work led us to identify a new metabolite within lysine metabolism (6-oxo-pipecolate) that we later applied to newborn screening. Our current research focuses on impact of global metabolic dysfunction and the impact of &alpha;-AASA dehydrogenase deficiency. This work is funded by NIH/NICHD and the CurePDE Foundation.

          text: |
            Although lysine reduction therapies improve clinical outcomes, nutritional based treatments are diffiuclt and associted with a negative impact on quality of life. We collaborate with the CHARLIE consoritum, other scientists, biotech, and pharmaceutical partners to evalute genetic based therapies for PDE-ALDH7A1. This includes several approaches to substrate reduction therapy. This work is funded by philanthropic donations and the CurePDE Foundation.
