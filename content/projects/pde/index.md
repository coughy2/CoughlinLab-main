            We collaborate with PDE-ALDH7A1 experts including Professors Clara van Karnebeek, Sidney Gospe Jr, and members of the International PDE Consortium. Our work directly led to lysine-restricted diet and triple therapy (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, lysine-restricted diet, arginine supplementation) being adopated as standard of care treatment.

            We aim to understand underlying disease mechansim of PDE-ALDH7A1 with a focus on biochemistry. This work led us to identify a new metabolite within lysine metabolism (6-oxo-pipecolate) that we later applied to newborn screening. Our current research focuses on global metabolic dysfunction and the impact of &alpha;-AASA dehydrogenase deficiency. This work is funded by NIH/NICHD and the CurePDE Foundation.

            Although lysine reduction therapies improve clinical outcomes, nutritional based treatments are difficult and associted with a negative impact on quality of life. We collaborate with the CHARLIE consoritum, other scientists, and industry partners to evalute genetic based therapies for PDE-ALDH7A1. This includes several approaches to substrate reduction therapy. This work is funded by philanthropic donations and the CurePDE Foundation.
