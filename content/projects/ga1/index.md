        **Glutaric Aciduria Type 1**
      text: |
        This work is based on 50 years of GA1 research led by Professor Steve Goodman. Dr. Goodman was a mentor to Drs. Coughlin and Woontner and a preeminent scientist. A breif description of his career is described below.

            Newborn screening (NBS) dramatically changed the natural history of GA1,  although many patients continue to have devestating symptomes. We aim to understand the post NBS natural history of GA1 including the number of patients who have a basal ganglia injury and non-strital (i.e. non metabolic stroke) symptoms. This data is critial in developing future treatments. This work is funded by NIH (ROAR consoritum) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. We also work closely with patient and advocay groups to accomplish these goals.

            We focus on the underlying disease mechansim of GA1 and how abnormal metabolism impacts disease phenotype. Our reserach utilizes a zebrafish model which has several advantages to studying this glial cell disorder. We also collaborate with scientist to evalute novel genetic and cellular therapies for GA1 The  This work is currently funded internally.

            Professor Goodman was a leader in the field of inborn errors of metabolism and founding member of the Society of Inherited Metabolic Disorders. Over his distingused 55 year carreer, his primary focus was glutaric aciduria type 1 and 2. Among other accomplishements, he described the first patient with GA1, identified the gene *GCDH*, and described the enzyme deficiency in GA1. He developed a mouse model that still used by several laboratories today to study GA1. He was invovled in many clinical studies describing the features of patients with GA1 and the initial guidelines for management.
