        **Glutaric Aciduria Type 1**
      text: |
        This work is based on 50 years of GA1 focused research led by Professor Steve Goodman. Dr. Goodman was a formal mentor to Drs. Coughlin and Woontner and a preeminent GA1 researcher. A breif description of his career and impact on our current research is described below.

            Newborn screening dramatically changed the natural history of GA1,  although many patients continue to have devestating symptomes. We aim to understand the current natural history of GA1 including the number of patients who have a basal ganglia injury and non-strital (i.e. non metabolic stroke) symptoms. This data is critial in developing future treatments. This work is funded by NIH (ROAR consoritum) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. We also work closely with patient and advocay groups to accomplish these goals.

            We aim to understand the underlying disease mechansim of GA1 with a focus on biochemistry. Our work has focused on a zebrafish model which has several advantages to studying early develpoment changes in this glial cell disorder. We also collaborate with scientist around the world evaluting novel genetic and cellular therapies for GA1 The  This work is currently funded internally(Univeristy of Colorado Anschutz).

            Professor Goodman was a leader in the field of inborn errors of metabolism and founding member of the Society of Inherited Metabolic Disorders. Over his distingused 55 year carreer, his major research focus was glutaric aciduria type 1 and 2. Among other accomplishements, he described the first two siblings with GA1 who presented after a minor illness. He charecterized the biochemical anomalies, identified the gene *GCDH*, and described the enzyme deficiency in GA1. He developed a mouse model still used today to study GA1. He was invovled in many clinical studies describing the features of patients and developing guidelines for management.
