We are excited to be part of the Rare Organic Acidemias Research ([ROAR](https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/roar)) Consorium as part of the RDCRN. Baylor College and Texas Children's Hospital will lead the clinical projects including a prospective longitudinal observational study of patient phenotypes and outcomes, a clinical trial of treatment for cobalamin C, and a randomized trial comparing virtual outpatient visits with in-person outpatient care.  

We (Children's Hospital Colorado) are excited to be one of the 5 clinical sites and hope to extend our work on Glutaric Aciduria Type 1 within the ROAR consoritum.
