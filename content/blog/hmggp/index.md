Nicole presented her early work focused on interpreting variants of unknown significance for two inborn errors of metabolism: pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.  This work focused on both measuring enzyme activity using an e.coli-based expression vector and RNA studies using an OTC minigene. 

Nicole will also present these projects at the [Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders](https://simd.org/) meeting in May 2026.
