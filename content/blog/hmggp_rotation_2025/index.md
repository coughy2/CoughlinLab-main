Nicole García Tubéns completed her second rotation in the lab and presented her work focused on measuring metabolites in our zebrafish animal model.  Nicole is a 1st year student in the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home) PhD program and it was a joy to have her in the lab.  We wish her success as she completes her first year and hope she considers our lab as a possible home for her doctoral training.
