### Podcast Overview
Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is a rare but treatable disorder. This lecture will focus on the use of lysine-reduction threapies (LRT). Treatment with both B6 and LRT in the first few months of life can significanly improve the IQ of patients with PDE and suggests that patients would benefit from a traditional newborn screening approach.
