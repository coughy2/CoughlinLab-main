summary: his lecture will focus on the impact of neonatal treatment and developmental outcomes and new biomarkers for PDE-ALDH7A1.
abstract: 'We suggest that PDE-ALDH7A1 is an ideal condition for newborn screening. Treatment with pyridoxine and LRT in the first few months of life can dramatically improve the outcome for this disorder. And our preliminary data suggests that PDE-ALDH7A1 could be added to current newborn screening programs. Newborn screening would allow for treatment of more than just the epilepsy that previously defined this disorder. '
